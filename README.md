# WiCS-Website
A website for Women in Computer Science Club at Amherst College. Django web application hosted on Heroku.

As president of the WiCS Club, I created a website to provide information about our mission and events throughout the school year. The site also allows prospective members to join our mailing list. I integrated a Google Calendar plug-in to assure all events are up to date and can be easily edited in an external Google Calendar for club events, meetings, and tech opportunities.
